"""Device availability policy (pure) — see docs/device-availability.md.

The DB holds the availability state on each device; this module holds the
*decisions* about it, free of I/O so they can be unit-tested without a bench:

* classify an outage as ``temporary`` (self-heal-eligible) or ``permanent``,
* decide, for a temporary outage, whether to attempt rectification now / wait /
  give up (the ≤3-tries-over-~3-min budget), and the backoff between tries,
* render a device row into the ``GET /v1/targets`` availability record.

The async reconciler (next increment) is a thin timer that calls ``next_retry``
and runs the presence probe; it owns no policy of its own.
